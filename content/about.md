At Works Without WiFi, our mission is simple:  
**Help people find technology that doesn’t depend on the internet.**

From off-grid homes to privacy-conscious parents, many people want tools that “just work” — without apps, accounts, or cloud connections.

We curate and review the best offline products in categories like:

-   Baby monitors with no WiFi
-   Phones for kids or seniors
-   Smart home tech that works locally
-   Offline entertainment and tools

Whether you’re going off the grid or just off the cloud, we’re here to help.

_Built by a team that believes in simplicity, privacy, and resilience._
